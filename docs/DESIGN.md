# TaskMuse Design Overview

This document outlines the high-level design for the desktop website and the mobile application of TaskMuse.

## 1. Desktop Website

**Tech Stack**: React with TypeScript, styled-components for styling.

**Pages**:
- **Dashboard**: Displays the user's task list, status filters, and quick actions.
- **Task Details**: Allows viewing and editing individual tasks.
- **Account Settings**: Profile management and sign out.

**Layout Notes**:
- Responsive layout with a left navigation sidebar on large screens.
- Main content area shows lists and forms.
- Use a top bar for notifications and user profile access.

## 2. Mobile App

**Tech Stack**: React Native (Expo).

**Screens**:
- **Home**: List of tasks with ability to add or complete items.
- **Task Edit**: Create or modify tasks.
- **Settings**: User preferences and account options.

**UI Notes**:
- Bottom tab navigation: Home | Add Task | Settings.
- Use platform-aware components (e.g., date pickers).
- Support offline mode for task creation and sync when online.

## Shared Design Considerations

- Consistent color palette and typography across both platforms.
- Reuse API endpoints from the FastAPI backend.
- Authentication via token-based system.
